# Password Generator

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to use JavaScript to create a password generator that is capable of being tailored to the clients' needs. Clients are able to choose what type of characters they'd like to include (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters), and how long they'd like their password to be (between 8 and 128 characters). This was accomplished by traversing the DOM and using JavaScript events.

 <!-- As an added benefit, the site is responsive and can easily be used on any device.   -->

## Features
- Customizable password length and character options
- Responsive design and functionality 
- Accessible for screen readers
- Interactive `generate password` button


## Insights

While creating this password generator I gained a better understanding of the DOM and Javascript events. I also learned how to concatenate arrays to form a full character set and how to randomly select elements from an array using safe boundary checking.
